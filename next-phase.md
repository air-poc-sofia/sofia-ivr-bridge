# What Comes Next

Per the BMad workflow, the next required step in the 3-solutioning phase is:

> Create Epics and Stories (CE)  
> /bmad-bmm-create-epics-and-stories  
> Agent: 📋 John (Product Manager)  
> Create the Epics and Stories listing from the PRD + Architecture

After that, there's a required implementation readiness check:

> Check Implementation Readiness (IR)  
> /bmad-bmm-check-implementation-readiness  
> Agent: 🏗️ Winston (Architect)  
> Ensure PRD, Architecture, and Epics/Stories are aligned before implementation

Run each workflow in a fresh context window so the agent gets a clean token budget for the full document set.
